# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

about-author: " I talk to the wind, The wind cannot hear. 凌晨开车越过山道, 透过前窗玻璃, 看到外面悬着薄薄一层雾气. 这时我就会想起王小波说过的: 冷牛般的雾, 这个比喻. 所有动的, 不动的都被困在冷冰冰的白色里." # add description
